Hi Peter, for running the “Restore Backup” command against a running Docker container you can do something like this:
docker exec b0b59e2ca087 java org.exist.start.Main backup --restore /some/path/inside/conatiner/backup-dir/my-backup.zip
Replace the b0b59e2ca087 with either the ID or Name of your running eXist-db Docker container.
Also obviously replace /some/path/inside/conatiner/backup-dir/my-backup.zip with the path to where you mount your eXist-db database backup within the container
